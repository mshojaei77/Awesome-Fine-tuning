# A Step-by-Step Guide to Fine-tuning a LLM

Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering unprecedented capabilities in tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation. This transformative approach leverages pre-trained models, enhancing their performance on specific domains through the fine-tuning process.
LLMs are pushing the boundaries of what was previously considered achievable with capabilities ranging from language translation to sentiment analysis and text generation.
However, we all know training such models is time-consuming and expensive. This is why, fine-tuning large language models is important for tailoring these advanced algorithms to specific tasks or domains.
This process enhances the model's performance on specialized tasks and significantly broadens its applicability across various fields. This means we can take advantage of the Natural Language Processing capacity of pre-trained LLMs and further train them to perform our specific tasks.

# Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
The most straightforward and common fine-tuning approach. The model is further trained on a labeled dataset specific to the target task to perform, such as text classification or named entity recognition.
To carry out SFT on an LLM, you need data. More specifically, if you want to fine-tune a chatbot to successfully answer user requests, you need instruction data. There are many open source datasets which are instruction-based and you can use.

- [Hugging Face SFTTrainer ](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/sft_trainer) is a specialized tool in the Hugging Face Transformers library designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tasks, making it easier to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks using smaller datasets. It simplifies the process by offering a streamlined workflow with fewer configuration options, ensuring efficient memory usage through techniques like parameter-efficient (PEFT) and packing optimizations, and achieving faster training times compared to the general-purpose `Trainer`. This makes it particularly useful for beginners looking to fine-tune models without needing extensive knowledge of deep learning configurations.


## Full Fine-Tuning
In full fine-tuning, we optimize or train all layers of the neural network. This approach typically yields the best results but is also the most resource-intensive and time-consuming.
The most conceptually straightforward means of fine-tuning is to simply update the entire neural network. This simple methodology essentially resembles the pre-training process: the only fundamental differences between the full fine-tuning and pre-training processes are the dataset being used and the initial state of the model’s parameters.

To avoid destabilizing changes from the fine-tuning process, certain hyperparameters—model attributes that influence the learning process but are not themselves learnable parameters—might be adjusted relative to their specifications during pre-training: for example, a smaller learning rate (which reduces the magnitude of each update to model weights) is less likely to lead to catastrophic forgetting.
